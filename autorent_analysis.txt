The one-to-one relationship between Vehicles and Rental_Agreements allows for the handling of new vehicles, agreement updates and vehicle availability.
When a new vehicle is added it will not be added into the rental agreements until the vehicleis rented out. An update to the agreement will not affect the vehicle entity meaning customer data can be edited with no effect on the vehicle. Vehicle availability checks can be preformed easily with the rental agreements as any vehicle in a rental agreement would not be available to be rented. Every vehicle can only be tied to one agreement and only one agreement can only have one vehicle.
